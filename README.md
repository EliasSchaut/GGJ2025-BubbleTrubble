# GGJ2025-BubbleTrubble
This game was part of the [Global Game Jam 2025](https://globalgamejam.org/games/2025/bubbletrubble-1)

## Gameplay
Four players (local co-op with controllers) must defend their ship against the enemies. Luckily, you have your four turrets and a bubble factory to produce ammunition. Enemies are built from distinct colors, so you need to shoot the matching color bubbles at them. For example, a red and blue ship needs a red and blue bubble attached to them - but beware, the bubbles will not stick to the enemies forever. Each gun has three slots with bullets, switch with X, A, B and use Y to select whether to take new bubbles from the belt. Leave the turret using the right shoulder button. Use the coloring stations to color the bubbles, mixing them to create complex colors.
